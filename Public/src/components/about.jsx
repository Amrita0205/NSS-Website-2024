                        National Service Scheme is a social service program sponsored by the Indian Government that sprang from the belief of the Mahatma that the difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would solve most of our problems. IIIT Raichur has had its unit of NSS since 2019, the founding year of the institute.

                        NSS at IIIT Raichur is aimed at providing each student with a significant context in which he/she can reach a deeper understanding of social reality in India today. NSS encourages the meaning of life through service in today's changing world. The volunteers of this organization have the motto 
                        <strong> "Not Me, But You" </strong>, which showcases the belief in selflessness and is reflected in their work to ensure everyone in need gets help. Activities include Vidyadaan, cloth donation, blood donation camps, and orphanage visits.
